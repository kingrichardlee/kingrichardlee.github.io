    <h7>Looking for Authentic Birdhouses for Cheep?</h7>
    <h3>Get it? Cheep? Like the sound birds make?</h3>

    <p>Hey guy, my name is Bertram [Last Name Redacted]. If you're like me, you like birds, but HATE the government! What's a guy to do when they're tracing your DNA through your online credit card purchases? Luckily for you, my service offers analog birdhouse deliveries that can be paid in cash! It's kind of like geo-caching, but not tied to the great Portugeuse conspiracy of October 12th, 2003...</p>
